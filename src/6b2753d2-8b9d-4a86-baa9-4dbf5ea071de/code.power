**Custom Admin Views** give you complete freedom to define bespoke administrative interfaces  
within your Joomla components — without being limited to Joomla's default view generators.

They are the **admin-side counterpart to Site Views**, built using:
- **Templates** and **Layouts** (for structural rendering)
- **Dynamic Gets** (for advanced data querying)
- **Custom Code** (for reusable backend logic or overrides)
- Optional **JavaScript and CSS Libraries**

Custom Admin Views let you create:
- Data dashboards
- Import/export areas
- Report generators
- One-off administrative tools
- Multi-tab editing views
...all from inside JCB.

This turns Joomla's back-end into a **powerful canvas** for any interface you envision —  
fully powered by the same JCB architecture used throughout the frontend.

		$readme[] = <<<MD
Each Custom Admin View can be:
- An **Item View** (display a single entity)
- A **List View** (show multiple items with pagination)
- A **Hybrid or Utility View** (batch editing, uploading, dashboards, etc.)

These views are built through:
- One or more **Dynamic Gets** to fetch related data across tables
- Optional integration of **Forms**, **Filters**, or **Toolbars**
- **Templates and Layouts** for structuring how content is displayed
- **Custom Code Blocks** to inject logic at strategic compile points

This gives you complete control over both data and design.

Just like other JCB-powered assets, Custom Admin Views support version-controlled workflows:

- **Init** a Custom Admin View from this repository
- **Reset** to sync with the latest updates
- **Push** your own improved versions
- Or **Fork** the repo to fully customize your private admin interfaces

Every Custom Admin View can evolve with your project's back-end needs,  
and JCB ensures your changes are safely retained through the compile lifecycle.

> Admin interface design should never be an afterthought. With Custom Admin Views, you own the experience — from logic to layout, all inside Joomla Component Builder.
